### TODO:
- [x] Scan directory to find files (thanks [@corruptmemry](https://github.com/corruptmemry) for this!)
- [x] Split extensions to determine file type (also thanks [@corruptmemry](https://github.com/corruptmemry) for this!)
- [x] Move files (and here also thanks [@corruptmemry](https://github.com/corruptmemry) for this!)
- [ ] Add more file extensions (probably will never be checked because there is a LOT of extensions)

### How to use this utility?
Just drop the main.py and config.json in the folder that need to be sorted and run the script

P.S. Probably I`ll make something like package or executable idk, if i don't be lazy.

### How can I help?
Feel free to fork this repo and make a pull request or create an issue, if you encountered an problem!
